AI-Powered Job Description to Learning Path Generator

This is a smart web application that transforms any job description into a comprehensive, interactive learning roadmap.

It goes beyond simple lists by using a novel, multi-API approach:

Google Gemini analyzes the job description to extract a structured learning path.

Exa AI's Search API finds the most relevant tutorials, project ideas, and interview questions for each step.

Exa AI's Get Contents API + Gemini work together to provide on-demand, synthesized explanations of key concepts, creating an interactive learning tool instead of just a list of links.

⚙️ Setup & Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need Node.js and npm installed.

1. Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME


2. Install backend dependencies:

npm install


3. Create your environment file:
Create a file named .env in the root of the project directory. This file will hold your secret API keys.

4. Add your API keys to .env:
Open the .env file and add your keys. Do not use quotes.

GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY
EXA_API_KEY=YOUR_EXA_API_KEY


5. IMPORTANT: Create a .gitignore file:
Create a file named .gitignore in the root of the project directory. This will prevent you from accidentally uploading your secret keys to GitHub.

# Node.js dependencies
node_modules/

# Environment variables
.env


6. Run the server:

node server.js


Your server will start, usually on http://localhost:3000.

7. Open the app:
You can now open the index.html file directly in your browser. It will automatically connect to your local server.
